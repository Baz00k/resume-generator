Create a beautiful resume and website in seconds

## Description

Are you looking to showcase your skills with a beautiful resume and website? Tired of searching for templates or lacking UI/UX skills? Then this project is for you!

This resume generator creates a website where you or recruiters can download your CV as PDF. Simply choose a template, fill in your information using markdown, and you're ready to go!

As any valid markdown, svelte or html syntax is allowed, you can customize your resume as much as you want. Custom styling? We got you. Just use tailwind classes. You can even add your own components!

Want to use icons? No problem! Use already included `svelte-awesome-icons` just like you would use any other component or install any other icon library you want.

2. Choose a right template for you from the `layouts` folder and edit `src/pages/+page.svx` file
3. Enable GitHub Pages in the settings of your forked repository
